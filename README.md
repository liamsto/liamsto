## Hello, I'm Liam.

### About me
I’m an offensive security practitioner, primarily training on Hack The Box (see my profile for stats and progress tracking). My core offensive strengths include:
* AD/LDAP exploitation: enumeration-to-compromise (I primarily use BloodHound), Kerberos abuse (AS-REP roasting, Kerberoasting, constrained/unconstrained delegation scenarios), ACL/GPO misconfigurations, certificate services attack paths, lateral movement, and privilege escalation in multi-domain environments.
* Binary exploitation: vulnerability discovery and exploit development across a wide variety of architectures, modern mitigations (ASLR, NX, PIE, canaries, RELRO) and bypass strategies, ROP chaining, and binary debugging (pwndbg primarily).
* Web exploitation: authentication/authorization flaws, injection classes (SQLi/NoSQLi/command injection), SSRF/file inclusion/deserialization. 
* Wireless and network offensive operations: Wi-Fi security assessment (WPA2/WPA3, rogue AP/evil-twin), internal network service exploitation (SMB/WinRM/RPC/LDAP chaining), and traffic analysis for credential exposure and pivot.

On the defensive side, my strengths include:
* Reverse engineering (I really love Ghidra): static analysis, function and type recovery, decompilation-driven auditing, patch diffing, and translating findings into actionable theories.
* Malware and exploit analysis: unpacking/triage, behavioral analysis, identifying IOCs and persistence mechanisms, and mapping functionality to ATT&CK techniques for reporting and detection engineering.


I also do some programming in Rust, and a lot of tinkering around with x86, RISC-V, and Raspberry Pis when I get a chance.
### HackTheBox Badges
Below are some of the rarest HTB badges I've achieved. I have a lot more,
<a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/users/481501?tab=badges">of course</a>,
but these are the hardest, most interesting ones I have completed, in no particular order. All these machines and challenges are Insane level difficulty. Click on any of the images to view them on my HTB profile and see the rarities for yourself:
